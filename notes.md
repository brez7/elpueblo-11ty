Here’s the context of my Eleventy project. Please load this. progress of project with the first info being most recent.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This is a content-rich static site built with [11ty (Eleventy)](https://11ty.dev). It integrates:

- Custom GitHub polling logic via Python
- Firebase Hosting + optional Cloud Functions
- Custom templates and layouts for content like locations, menus, and blog-style posts

The project uses a structured source folder and a Python-based data fetcher to pull GitHub info into Eleventy templates dynamically.

### 🧱 **Project Setup & Goals**

- You’re building a static site with **Eleventy (11ty)** and deploying via **Firebase Hosting**.
- You wanted a **fully customizable contact form** that integrates with your site.
- We explored whether to use **Firebase Functions** or a **Flask API with Cloud Run** — you chose Flask on Cloud Run for flexibility.

---

### ⚙️ **Flask + Cloud Run Setup**

1. Created a `contact-form-api/` directory with `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and a `Dockerfile`.
2. Flask app included a `/submit` endpoint that receives form data via POST.
3. Docker image was built and deployed to **Google Cloud Run** using:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/upbeat-button-265722/contact-form
   gcloud run deploy contact-form --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/upbeat-button-265722/contact-form --platform managed --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
   ```
4. Eleventy site submits the form via `fetch()` to the live Cloud Run endpoint.

---

### 🚨 **CORS Issue & Fix**

- You hit a CORS error when testing the form.
- Solution: Installed `flask-cors` and added:
  ```python
  CORS(app, origins="*", methods=["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"])
  ```
- Also handled `OPTIONS` requests explicitly in the Flask route.

---

### 📬 **Sending Emails via Gmail**

- Created a Gmail **App Password** for `it@elpueblomex.com`
- Updated Flask to send email via `smtplib` using:
  ```python
  smtp.login(GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PASSWORD)
  smtp.send_message(msg)
  ```
- Emails now arrive successfully in the inbox.

---

### 📊 **Logging Submissions to Google Sheets (in progress)**

- Created a Google Sheet with headers: `Timestamp | Name | Email | Message`
- Set up a **Service Account** with access to Google Sheets API
- Shared the sheet with the service account
- Downloaded the JSON credentials file
- Preparing to use `gspread` or `google-api-python-client` to log submissions from Flask

⚙️ Environment
Project: yummy-elpueblo-11ty

Backend: contact-form-api

Serving With: Flask + Gunicorn

Docker Registry: Artifact Registry (NOT GCR)

Deployment Target: Cloud Run (upbeat-button-265722)

Local Dev: WSL + PowerShell mix

Email Destinations: rob@elpueblomex.com, rob@barbank.com

✅ Command Style
Always inline, even if multi-line

No backslashes \

PowerShell by default if unspecified, otherwise WSL when running inside Linux shell

🧠 Goal
You wanted to display recent blog post previews on your Eleventy-powered homepage (index.njk) and encountered issues with collections and layout.

✅ What We Diagnosed and Solved

1. Blog Posts Not Showing on Homepage
   Your blog posts were correctly tagged and visible on the blog listing page.

However, they were not rendering on the homepage.

We confirmed collections.blog had 6 posts, but collections.blogLatest returned 0.

2. Issue with slice() in .eleventy.js
   Using .slice(0, 3) directly in a custom collection (blogLatest) caused it to return an empty array due to build timing issues.

Fix: Instead of slicing in .eleventy.js, we now slice inside the template using:

njk
Copy
Edit
{% set blogLatest = collections.blog.slice(0, 3) %} 3. Rendering Fix
Updated the index.njk to:

Use collections.blog.slice(0, 3)

Render Bootstrap card layout like your latest-news.njk template

Fixed layout bugs and ensured visibility

4. HTML Cleanup
   Resolved an invalid {# ... #} Nunjucks comment block that caused HTML parsing errors

Ensured all tags in your homepage template were correctly opened and closed

5. Updated .eleventy.js
   Cleaned it up to include:

blog collection only (no need for blogLatest)

Luxon-based date filter

Passthrough copy for assets

Correct directory configuration

✅ Final State
✅ Blog posts show on homepage via collections.blog.slice(0, 3)

✅ No Eleventy build errors

✅ Clean and maintainable index.njk and .eleventy.js

⚙️ Environment

1. Signature and Initials Styling in Email
You updated the .njk file to display each certification paragraph followed by its corresponding initial box (canvas). You wanted the email to reflect this exact layout, with each paragraph displayed clearly and the matching image (initial) right below it.

2. Email Image Rendering
You changed the height of <img> tags (e.g., height="85"), but they didn’t appear updated locally. We confirmed it was due to HTML email client caching or not rebuilding/redeploying.

3. Form Field Adjustment
You tried to add rows="4" to an <input> for employmentHistory, but it didn’t work. I explained that <input type="text"> doesn’t support rows; you should use a <textarea> instead.

4. Email Display Color
You noticed some fields in the email appeared purple. This was likely due to your local email client styling (e.g., Gmail marking visited or autofilled text).

5. Preparing for Cloud Run Deployment (v350, then v360)
You declared readiness to push the Dockerfile live as version v350. Later, you wanted to deploy version v360 and confirmed the correct project ID: upbeat-button-265722.

6. Domain Confusion
You noticed the deployed service URL changed unexpectedly (from https://contact-form-api... to https://el-pueblo-api...). We discussed that Cloud Run uses service names for the default URL, and that the contact-form-api service must be explicitly specified to retain the URL.

7. Date Format Fix
You wanted the date in the notification email to appear as month/day/year instead of YYYY-MM-DD. We noted that the .njk form field needs no change — formatting should be handled in app.py.

8. Docker Push Errors
You tried pushing the Docker image and encountered errors like name unknown: Repository "contact-form-api" not found. I explained this was likely due to not enabling or creating the Artifact Registry repository for your region (us-central1).

9. GCloud Output Issues
Your gcloud command gave an OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument, which is a known PowerShell encoding issue when outputting to stdout.

10. Final Deployment Command
You requested a corrected gcloud run deploy command using the confirmed service URL (https://contact-form-api...). I gave the full command to deploy version v360 using Artifact Registry and contact-form-api as the service name.

Since the last progress report, we’ve completed the full job application form on the job-openings.njk page, including all required fields, date and dropdown selectors, and grouped sections for personal, employment, and legal information. We added JavaScript logic to auto-fill the form with test data for faster testing. We also integrated three initial pads and one signature pad using canvas elements, with both mouse and touch support. These pads are converted to base64 images and sent as part of the form submission payload.

On the backend, we created the /jobs route in app.py to handle job application submissions. This route validates all required fields, logs the data into Sheet3 on Google Sheets, and returns a proper JSON response. We also added a new email function that sends the full application details to rob@elpueblomex.com and rob@barbank.com. The email now includes inline-rendered images of the initials and signature.

For local testing, we set up the Eleventy server at http://localhost:8080 and the Flask API at http://localhost:5000. We updated the CORS logic to support local development and resolved all preflight issues affecting /submit, /reserve, and /jobs. The forms and endpoints are now working reliably in both dev and production.

Rob began developing a third form for El Pueblo’s Eleventy-based website to collect job applications. He requested a full HTML form with specified fields, including dropdowns, text inputs, and required markers. The form would eventually include signature pads, but those were postponed. Initially, the form used <textarea> fields, but Rob clarified that all fields should use single-line inputs unless otherwise specified. Special cases like the references and felony explanation fields were updated to use multiline <textarea> elements with 4 rows for better usability.

Once the full form was built, JavaScript was added to handle POST submissions using fetch() to a new /jobs endpoint on the Flask API, hosted on Google Cloud Run. On the backend, Rob implemented the /jobs route in app.py, which receives the submission, validates required fields, logs data into “Sheet3” of the existing Google Sheet, and returns a JSON response. Optional email notifications are supported.

The form uses Eleventy’s dev server for local preview and testing at localhost:8080/job-openings.html, avoiding the need to deploy to Firebase during development. This streamlined local workflow allows Rob to test layout, validation, and API responses efficiently before pushing to production. The setup is now ready for signature support and email confirmations.

Rob worked on expanding the Eleventy-based static site for El Pueblo Mexican Food by integrating multiple backend forms using a Flask API deployed to Google Cloud Run. After resolving CORS issues and Cloud Run deployment bugs, both the contact form (/submit) and reservation form (/reserve) were made fully functional, including Google Sheets logging and email notifications via Gmail SMTP.

Later, issues arose while attempting to center a confirmation message returned by the reservation form. This led to miscommunication between frontend display logic and Flask routes. Docker images weren't properly rebuilt during those changes, which caused inconsistencies in behavior. Rebuilding and redeploying the Docker image resolved those errors.

Rob then created a new job-openings.njk page to collect employment applications. A full form was built with all fields, including select inputs and formatted one-line text areas. The backend /jobs endpoint was implemented to log submissions to “Sheet3” of the existing spreadsheet and return success messages via JSON.

The form is now connected via JavaScript using fetch() with appropriate error handling and required field validation. Future steps may include adding digital signature fields and email confirmations. Everything is now working smoothly again after the final redeploy and script updates.

You began by building two form endpoints—/submit for contact messages and /reserve for party reservations—using Flask, hosted on Google Cloud Run, and integrated with Google Sheets and Gmail. The backend was Dockerized, and deployment was managed via gcloud run deploy.

Initially, the reservation form was returning CORS and 404 errors, even though the route was correctly defined in app.py. You verified the route with @app.route("/reserve", methods=["POST", "OPTIONS"]) and ensured CORS headers were set. The real issue turned out to be Cloud Run not serving the most recent image despite rebuilding with docker build. This was fixed by using versioned tags like v10, v200, and deploying them cleanly, avoiding image cache issues with --no-cache.

Another problem was with how you tested the routes using curl in PowerShell. Many errors stemmed from PowerShell syntax differences (like backticks and escaping quotes), which led to confusing 400 and 404 errors. Eventually, you tested the endpoints successfully using both curl and Invoke-RestMethod.

You also ran into a confusing situation where the contact form stopped working, while the reservation form worked fine. After investigating, you discovered the contact form was still pointing to the old Cloud Run URL (abc123), while the reservation form had the updated one (v200). Once you corrected the endpoint in contact.njk, both forms worked properly.

Ultimately, the main problems were outdated frontend URLs, Docker image caching, and inconsistent deployment. These were resolved by confirming route definitions, verifying deployed versions, and syncing frontend service URLs.

Now both forms are working, and the stack is running smoothly on Cloud Run with email notifications and Google Sheets logging fully functional.

You’re working on an Eleventy-based static site with a Flask API deployed to Google Cloud Run. After successfully deploying a working /submit contact form endpoint, you built a new /reserve endpoint to handle party reservation form data. Despite validating the route existed in your Docker build, hitting /reserve on Cloud Run consistently returned a 404 error, which initially appeared to be a CORS issue.

After investigation, it became clear that the actual problem was that Cloud Run was serving an older version of your container — one that didn’t include /reserve. Even though you rebuilt the Docker image and tagged it :v2, Cloud Run kept deploying the same image digest (sha256:3cf3...). This meant your changes weren’t reaching production.

We confirmed that the issue stemmed from gcloud crashing during deploy due to a Windows-specific OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument, related to terminal encoding. This crash silently prevented your gcloud run deploy command from finishing successfully.

To resolve this:

You set PowerShell’s output encoding using $OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

Then rebuilt the Docker image using a fresh tag like :v3

Pushed it to Artifact Registry

Explicitly deployed the new image using the full tag with gcloud run deploy

You were instructed to verify the new revision in the Cloud Run console and test the route using PowerShell curl. This cleaned up any image caching issues and ensured /reserve is now correctly deployed and live.
You began by setting up an Eleventy (11ty) static site and integrating a contact form backend using Python Flask, deployed via Google Cloud Run. You created a contact-form-api with Flask, using Gmail SMTP for email delivery, and later added Google Sheets logging to track submissions. The backend correctly handled POST requests at /submit, verified using curl in both WSL and PowerShell environments.

We debugged several deployment and runtime issues. Early errors involved Cloud Run deployment failures due to image access from Google Container Registry (GCR), which is deprecated. We resolved this by pushing the Docker image to Artifact Registry instead. You also encountered an issue with secret scanning when trying to push the sheets-creds.json file to GitHub — GitHub's push protection blocked it due to it containing Google service credentials. We handled this by using .gitignore, removing the file from Git's index, and cleaning up commit history.

You successfully installed and ran Gunicorn within WSL to serve your Flask app. When transitioning to include Google Sheets, we configured OAuth scopes and used gspread and google-auth for appending form data to your spreadsheet. We overcame a submit() route duplication bug and installation errors related to distutils packages like blinker.

We updated the contact form logic so emails are sent to both rob@elpueblomex.com and rob@barbank.com, and added a confirmation email to be sent back to the person who filled out the form. Docker deployment scripts were tested and iterated on, with emphasis on inline PowerShell-compatible commands for tagging, pushing, and deploying.

Throughout the session, we reinforced using best practices for secrets management, deployment hygiene, and debugging Flask + Gunicorn issues on WSL.

You now have a fully functional contact form API that logs to Google Sheets, sends email notifications to admins, and sends confirmations to users.

In this session, we set up a fully customizable contact form for an Eleventy static site using a Flask API deployed on Google Cloud Run. After evaluating options, we chose Flask over Firebase Functions for greater flexibility and control. We built the Flask app with a /submit endpoint to handle POST requests, containerized it with Docker, and deployed it to Cloud Run using the Google Cloud CLI.

To handle browser security restrictions, we addressed a CORS error by integrating flask-cors and explicitly allowing cross-origin requests. Once the API was live, we wired up a frontend form in the Eleventy site to send submissions via fetch.

Next, we enabled Gmail integration by generating a secure App Password for it@elpueblomex.com and configured Flask to send emails via SMTP. After successful deployment and testing, we verified that the contact form was sending emails properly.

We also began integrating Google Sheets as a backend log for form submissions. This involved creating a new Google Sheet, setting up a service account, enabling the Google Sheets API, and preparing secure authentication credentials to allow Flask to write data to the sheet.

The session was highly productive, ending with a live contact form that sends real emails and is nearly ready for full data logging.
