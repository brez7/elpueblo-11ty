## What Are Buñuelos?

Buñuelos are a traditional Mexican dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. They are made by flattening and stretching dough, similar to tortillas, and then deep-frying until they achieve a golden-brown crispiness. The magic happens when they are taken out of the fryer and immediately coated with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. This coating adds a sweet, aromatic layer that elevates the simple tortilla into a heavenly dessert.
